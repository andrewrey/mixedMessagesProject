# Mixed Messages Project

Part of the JavaScript Syntax Porfolio. The small app is designed to ask the user their name and then asks if you would like a quote. After providing a quote it asks if you would like another. It will ask this until you say no. The app will provide a random quote using the Math object's random number method.
