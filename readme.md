# Mixed Messages Project

Part of the JavaScript Syntax Porfolio, this small app is designed to ask the user for their name and then asks if the user would like a quote. After providing a quote it then asks if the user would like another quote. It will ask this until it receives a "no" answer. The app will provide a random quote using the Math object's random number method. Chalk is a dependency in order to see the coloured output in the terminal.

## Technologies used

- Node.js
- Node's ReadLine module
- Chalk npm package (_dependency_)
- JavaScript
